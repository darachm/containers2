This is for tracking, hosting recipes for Singularity containers, such that
it can get mirrored on Github and singularity-hub can get it.

Organzation copied from [jlboat](https://github.com/jlboat/BioinfoContainers).
(Of course, makes total sense to just use tags to organize things!)

Some recipes are for individual tools, some are for workflows and so are
combos.
